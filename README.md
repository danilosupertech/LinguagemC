# C Language Lab

This repository is a collection of **C language practice projects and exercises** focused on building a strong foundation in low-level programming.

It contains multiple small programs and experiments developed while studying:
- pointers and memory
- data structures
- file handling
- modular C programs

## 📂 Repository Structure

Each folder represents an independent exercise or mini-project:

- `Ponteiros/` – pointer basics and memory access
- `Malloc&Realloc/` – dynamic memory allocation
- `Fila/` – queue data structure implementation
- `vetoresExercicios/` – array and vector exercises
- `contactManager/` – simple contact management system
- `CarrinhoCompras/` – shopping cart simulation
- `files/` – file handling examples
- `exercicios/` – general C exercises

Each directory may contain its own `README.md` explaining the specific goal of that exercise.

## 🧠 Topics Covered

- Pointers and memory management
- Dynamic allocation (`malloc`, `realloc`, `free`)
- Structs and modular code
- Data structures (queues, arrays)
- File I/O
- Command-line programs

## 🎯 Purpose

This repository serves as a **learning lab** for mastering C fundamentals and reinforcing concepts that are essential for systems programming and low-level software development.

## ⚠️ Notes

- All code is written for learning purposes.
- Projects are independent and may follow different styles depending on the learning phase.
